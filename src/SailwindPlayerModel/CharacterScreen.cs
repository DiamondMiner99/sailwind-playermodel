    /// this mod - co-op lives only in the in-game pause menu - and that constraint is convenient rather
    /// than limiting here: the avatar body template is CLONED FROM A SHOPKEEPER IN THE LOADED SCENE, so at
    /// the title screen there is no world, no template, and therefore nothing to preview or even enumerate.
    /// Being in-game is a precondition of this screen working at all.
    ///
    /// CURSOR: this panel deliberately does NO cursor bookkeeping whatsoever, and that is the design, not
    /// an omission. Vanilla's pause (StartMenu.GameToSettings) has already unlocked and shown the cursor
    /// and set GameState.inCursorMenu, so the cursor is free before we ever draw. The sibling
    /// CoopMessagePanel has to snapshot and restore cursor state because it can appear during gameplay,
    /// and that snapshot going stale is a real bug class - it can hand the player a free cursor while the
    /// camera still turns. Rather than repeat that machinery and its hazard, this screen simply REFUSES TO
    /// EXIST outside a cursor menu: it will not open unless GameState.inCursorMenu, and a per-frame
    /// watchdog closes it the moment that stops being true (resume, quit to menu, anything). A welded,
    /// cursor-stealing panel is then not merely handled, it is unreachable.
    ///
    /// ESCAPE: handled here and CONSUMED, because ModPauseMenu.OnEscape would otherwise resume the game
    /// in the same frame - Update runs before StartMenu's LateUpdate, so both would fire on one keypress
    /// and Escape would close the screen AND unpause.

    /// THE PARCHMENT IS HIDDEN while this is open. Leaving it visible behind a screen-space IMGUI panel
    /// lets a click pass through to the world-space button underneath - and one of those is Quit Game.
