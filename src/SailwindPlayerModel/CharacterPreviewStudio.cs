    /// below the world and drawn into a RenderTexture.
    ///
    /// WHY NOT JUST SHOW THE REAL BODY. That was the obvious approach and it cannot work. The real body
    /// forces SetVisible(BoatCamera.on &amp;&amp; GameState.currentShipyard == null) every frame, so on land or in
    /// first person the real body's renderers are DISABLED for the entire time the screen is open - which
    /// is exactly why the character was not visible next to the panel. Worse, in co-op the world is not
    /// even paused: ModPauseMenu.OnPauseOpened restores timeScale whenever the session is multiplayer and
    /// deliberately leaves the player mobile, so "the body is behind the menu" is not a place it stays.
    ///
    /// WHY NOT A MANNEQUIN IN FRONT OF THE LIVE CAMERA. Cheaper, but it renders inside the world: occluded
    /// by bulkheads, unlit at night, washed out in fog, clipped by the near plane. For a screen whose only
    /// job is judging a face, "sometimes you can see it" is a failure.
    ///
    /// SO: a self-contained rig on layer 31 (verified unnamed and unused in this build), lit by its own
    /// lights whose culling masks admit nothing else, photographed by its own disabled camera that we
    /// render by hand. No other camera's cullingMask is touched and no global render state is modified,
    /// so there is nothing to restore and nothing to leak if this goes wrong.
    ///
    /// It also carries its own watchdog: if the screen is closed by ANY path - button, key, or the
    /// inCursorMenu watchdog - the rig deletes itself on the next frame without being told.
