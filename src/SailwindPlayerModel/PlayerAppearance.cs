    /// What one character looks like, built on the Synty POLYGON modular character system that Sailwind
    /// already ships.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE. Every shopkeeper NPC in the game is a "Modular NPC" carrying a LIVE
    /// PsychoticLab.CharacterCustomizer, with the ENTIRE part library still present as disabled child
    /// objects - the editor-time Apply() bake that would have destroyed the unused parts was never run on
    /// any shipped NPC. So the body clone this mod makes has every head, hair, torso and leg variant sitting
    /// inside it, switched off. Roughly 720 skinned meshes across 41 group nodes.
    ///
    /// WHY EVERY BODY WOULD OTHERWISE LOOK IDENTICAL, and how that becomes the mechanism. BodyTemplate.Strip
    /// does NOT remove CharacterCustomizer, and every body path calls SetActive(true) on the
    /// clone. That fires CharacterCustomizer.Start(), which runs BuildLists() + ClearItems() + UpdateModel()
    /// and rebuilds the model from the SOURCE shopkeeper's serialized indices - overwriting anything set
    /// beforehand and stamping every player with the face of whichever shopkeeper happened to load first.
    /// The selection fields are all public ints, so the fix is not to fight that pass but to feed it: write
    /// the indices BEFORE activation and vanilla's own Start() applies the whole outfit, materials included.
    ///
    /// THEREFORE: Apply() MUST be called while the clone is still inactive. Calling it afterwards does
    /// nothing visible until something else re-runs UpdateModel.
    ///
    /// SAFETY. Indices arriving from the network are never trusted to index anything. They are clamped at
    /// apply time against the LIVE child count of the group on THIS machine, which is the only count that
    /// can actually be indexed here - deliberately not against a compiled-in table, because the body
    /// template is cloned from whichever shopkeeper loaded and a hardcoded count could drift past it. An
    /// unknown or out-of-range value degrades to that group's variant 0, so the worst case is a plain
    /// sailor rather than an invisible or T-posing one.
