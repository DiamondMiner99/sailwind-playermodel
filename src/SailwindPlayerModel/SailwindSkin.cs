    /// THE USEFUL SURPRISE: Sailwind contains NO TextMeshPro at all - no TMPro assembly in Managed/, no
    /// TMP references anywhere in the game code. Its entire UI is world-space UnityEngine.TextMesh driven
    /// by real UnityEngine.Font assets. That matters because a TMP_FontAsset CANNOT be assigned to a
    /// GUIStyle, so the usual answer for modded IMGUI is "match the colours and accept a mismatched
    /// font". Here the game's actual typeface is available, and it is a dynamic TrueType face, so
    /// GUIStyle.fontSize and fontStyle behave normally rather than being locked to a baked atlas size.
    ///
    /// The palette is sampled from the shipped assets rather than eyeballed: the start-menu scroll mesh
    /// uses material "scroll_item_paint", whose parchment swatch is #BD9D83 ramping to #524439, and the
    /// button plates are lit by an emission colour of #DBA583. Menu label text is near-black (17,17,19).
    ///
    /// Everything here degrades quietly: a missing font leaves IMGUI's default, and the colours stand on
    /// their own.
